Tumblelog application
(mongoDB & Flask tutorial)
http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tutorial/write-a-tumblelog-application-with-flask-mongoengine/


right before the step you run "python manage.py shell", you have to make the database

made db with
mongod --dbpath myDBpath
^ this is necessary to run the mongo command to get the mongo shell
when you run app, if you have mongo running in the background somewhere, the app will find it and connect

must instantiate database
use command line (run mongo for mongo shell)
this is separate from the rest of the python stuff
